Tuftsâ€™ Student Information System (SIS) is the university's central database for managing student academic records, biographical information, and financial data. It is crucial for departments such as the registrar, bursar, advising, and financial aid. SIS also enables students, faculty, and staff to perform tasks like searching for classes, viewing transcripts, grading, advising, and managing tuition and financial aid.

In this project, I conducted a usability test and root cause analysis to identify and address key issues within the SIS. Through detailed observations and interviews, I uncovered several usability problems. These included difficulties in finding alternative courses from the cart calendar, navigating financial aid information, requesting and sending official transcripts, using the degree audit for graduation requirements, reporting class absences, sharing financial information, viewing required textbooks, and accessing JumboCash.

The root causes of these issues were primarily linked to poor interface design, lack of clear guidance, and insufficient feature discoverability. To address these problems, I recommended several changes, such as enhancing feature visibility, streamlining navigation, providing clearer instructions, and improving communication about available features. These improvements aim to reduce user frustration, minimize errors, and enhance the overall safety and user-friendliness of the SIS.

### Observations

**Observation #1**
- **Description**: The feature to find an alternative course from the cart calendar was not easily apparent.
- **Root Caus**e: Lack of indication that you can find alternative courses directly from the cart calendar view, leading to user confusion and difficulty in finding the feature.
    
**Observation #2**
- **Description**: Finding the total financial aid received in the first year required navigating through several steps.
- **Root Cause**: Unintuitive and difficult-to-follow form for requesting an official transcript, possibly due to confusing wording and lack of clear guidance, leading to a long series of steps to access financial aid information.
    
**Observation #3**
- **Description**: Requesting an official transcript and sending it to another school was challenging due to an unintuitive form.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of clear indication and explanation of the form's purpose and functionality, making it difficult for users to understand and use it effectively for requesting official transcripts.
    
**Observation #4**
- **Description**: Difficulty in understanding and using the degree audit for viewing remaining graduation requirements.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of clear communication and guidance in the degree audit interface, leading to user confusion and difficulty in understanding how to use the degree audit for viewing graduation requirements.
    
**Observation #5**
- **Description**: Reporting an absence for a class next week was not easily discoverable.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of emphasis on the discoverability of the absence reporting feature, resulting in users being unaware of its existence and unable to easily find it in the SIS interface.

**Observation #6**
- **Description**: Allowing a new person to view financial aid information and bills was not straightforward.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of user-friendly options for sharing financial information with authorized individuals, leading to difficulties in allowing a new person to view financial aid information and bills.
    
**Observation #7**
- **Description**: It was not clear how to view the textbooks required for classes.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of clear guidance on accessing textbook information within the system, making it difficult for users to find the textbooks required for classes.

**Observation #8**
- **Description**: Unawareness that JumboCash can be accessed through SIS.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of awareness and education about JumboCash access options in SIS, leading to users being unaware that JumboCash can be accessed through SIS.**
